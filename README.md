AddressFilesProcessing
======================

Example of code that could be used to generate carrier sheets from reasonably well formatted address files


The specifics of the carrier sheet layout and teh associated log files are matched to the requirements of a certain company,
but are easily modified by changing the appropriate LaTeX generating commands.  Additionally, the indicia files included
with this project are not uploaded as they represnt confidential material - simply altering the picture directories in 
the main code and the filenames in the indicia handler file will allow any postage markings to be properly inserted
